Introduction: Introduction will be a short scripted sequence which takes the player throught the character creation system and a couple of practice fights before letting them
	      explore the world for themselves

Player starts as a villager and meets an old man that tells him about the (Whatever creature the boss is) that is living in the (centre?) of the map

Player is told to go to another village/city/place by the old man and they are given a weapon by him before they leave

Player then goes to (place) and has to engage in several small fights along the way

When they reach (place) they meet somone (main quest giver: knight? king?) who asks them about themselves (player chooses their class here)

The player is then given the goal of defeating the boss but is told to travel the lands first in order to build their strength (basically telling player to go do side quests)

Player then goes off freely in the game to do what they like
