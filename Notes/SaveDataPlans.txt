Assigning player saveID -
	During first save count the number of records in the CharacterData table and then add 1 to get saveID

Storing saveID in the game -
	First creation: Store as a variable in the game
	Other times: Take from database when player loads the game and set a boolean variable at the same time so the game knows to overwrite previous data and not
		     create a new save file/set of data for a player that already exists in the system

Saving player data -
	First: Create a new saveID for the player and add all current information to the player's database entry saving their character details in the CharacterData
	       table and their world information (position and progress etc) in the WorldState table
